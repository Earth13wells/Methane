# MMM Monitors Methane ✈️
Monitoring programs for an aerial methane monitor.  

### Included Program Files 🎪  
#### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
* README.md  
* arduino.ino
* sensehat.py
* heatmap.py  
* clean.sh  
### Introduction ✍️
#### ~~~~~~~~~~~~

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Air pollution is a dire health and
environmental threat at the forefront of humanity's concerns. As a result, there
 have been many studies focused on developing different environmental monitoring
  methods. Floating air monitors and towers that are currently being employed
  are efficient for data collection but are difficult to move to new places and
   air monitoring drones, although effective, can be quite expensive and are
   limited by their battery life. Theoretically, one can create a more effective
    drone for environmental monitoring by using a symmetrical fixed wing design.

### Purpose 🥅
#### ~~~~~~~
##### arduino.ino
* Reads data from Methane sensor
* Reads data from GPS sensor
* Runs on Arduino Nano ✈️
##### sensehat.py    
* Main data collection program
* Responsible for photos
* Responsible for arduino-pi communication
* Writes to output.csv   
* Collects Pressure, Temperature, Humidity, and time in form:  
* ```[1004.05615234375, 26.88888931274414, 44.61138916015625, '18:07:30']  ```
* Runs on RPi 🛩️  
##### clean.sh    
* Writes to cleanoutput.txt  
* Formats output.txt in form:  
* Pressure,              temp,              Humidity,              time  
* ``` [1004.05615234375    26.88888931274414    44.61138916015625    '18:07:30']  ```
